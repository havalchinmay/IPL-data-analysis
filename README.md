# IPL Data Analysis using PySpark

This project focuses on analyzing Indian Premier League (IPL) data using **PySpark**. The dataset used is sourced from [data.world](https://data.world/raghu543/ipl-data-till-2017) and stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. We perform various analytics tasks to gain insights into IPL matches, players, and teams.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Read the IPL ball-by-ball data from the S3 bucket.
   - Define the schema for the dataset.

2. **Data Exploration**:
   - Explore the structure of the dataset.
   - Understand the available columns and their meanings.

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values, if any.
   - Clean and transform relevant columns.

4. **Analytics Tasks**:
   - Calculate total runs scored by each team.
   - Identify top run-scorers and wicket-takers.
   - Analyze player performance across seasons.
   - Investigate match outcomes based on toss decisions.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Create visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line plots) to represent key insights.
